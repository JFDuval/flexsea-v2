# FlexSEA Communication Protocol v2.0

**FlexSEA: Flexible & Scalable Electronics Architecture**

## History and context

- 2013-2015: original work by Jean-FranÃ§ois (JF) Duval as part of his MIT Media Lab - Biomechatronics thesis work.
  - For documentation, refer to BioRob 2016 papers "FlexSEA: Flexible, Scalable Electronics Architecture for Wearable Robotic Applications" and "FlexSEA-Execute: Advanced Motion Controller for Wearable Robotic Applications", as well as to MIT thesis "FlexSEA: Flexible, Scalable Electronics Architecture for Wearable Robotic Applications".
  - "flexsea-comm" was part of the larger FlexSEA software project, but it wasn't usable as a standalone piece of comunication code
- 2015-20xx: project used and maintained by Dephy, Inc.
  - Sources hosted at https://github.com/JFDuval/ are licensed GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)
- 2024-2025: version 2.0
  - New repo (https://github.com/JFDuval/flexsea-v2) to get a clean start
  - This project is exclusively a communication stack
  - Goals: simpler code, improved API, easier integration with various projects, better unit test coverage
  - Same GPL-3.0 license, with an updated copyright to capture the full re-write

## Repository organization

FlexSEA Comm v2.0 is intended to be used with other projects. Therefore, it does not contain a `main()` or any application code. The 'projects' folder can be used to quickly build the stack as a static or dynamic library, and to run unit tests.

To test the stack on your PC use a project from the 'demo' folder. That folder also contains a demo project for a Nucleo-G431KB dev board.

- **src/:** Communication stack, source files
- **inc/:** Communication stack, header files
- **tests/:** Unit tests for the communication stack
- **projects/:**
  - **eclipse_pc/:** Eclipse C project that can be used to compile the communication stack (static and dynamic libs) and run unit tests.
- **demo/:**
  - **pc_c/:** Demo/test code written in C, with Eclipse C project. It compiles the stack (it doesn't use the static lib)
  - **pc_python/:** Demo/test code written in Python, with PyCharm project. You need to compile a DLL first. It can interact with the STM32 demo project.
  - **stm32_c/:** STM32 demo code. It's the default STM test project with a very minimalist stack integration. It can interact with the Python demo project.

## Setup & Integration

### List of software development tools

The specific versions are likely not critical, as long as they are current. What is listed below is simply what I happened to use during the development of this project.

- C IDE: Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers
- C compiler: GCC. I obtained it from https://www.msys2.org/.
  - If you use MSYS2, follow their instruction first.
  - Once the base installer has completed you need to run a few commands to get everything you need. I've been following [this guide](C:\msys64\mingw64\bin).
    - From the Start menu, open MSYS2 MING64
	- `pacman -Syu`
	- `pacman -Syu base-devel`
	- `pacman -Syu mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain`
  - Add the bin folder (ex.: C:\msys64\mingw64\bin) to your path. Reboot as needed.
  - Eclipse should now detect your compiler.
- Python IDE: PyCharm 2022.2.4 Community Edition (or newer)
- Python interpreter: Python 3.9 and 3.11 have been used with success
  - Packages to install: 'pyserial'
- Embedded C IDE: STM32CubeIDE with the STM32G4 source package

### Unity Unit Tests (optional)

1. Download Unity (https://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity), or clone the git repository
1. Create a folder named 'unity' and place it at the same level as your flexsea_v2 project
1. Copy `unity.c`, `unity.h` and `unity_internals.h` from the Unity/src folder into unity/ 
1. Open `unity.c`. If `setUp()` and `tearDown()` are not implemented, add `void setUp(void) {};` & `void tearDown(void) {};` to the file.
1. Run `tests.c`. If needed, exclude your project's `main()`.

### How to use the Eclipse PC C project (use this to compile a dynamic library)

#### Using the Eclipse IDE on Windows

- The first time you launch the installer, set the Workspace in the root folder (flexsea-v2/)
- Import projects... General > Existing Projkects into Workspace
- Select flexsea-v2\projects\eclipse_pc
- Active configurations are saved, but will need to be selected. The project has three configurations:
  - Test
  - StaticLib
  - DynamicLib
- Run/debug configs might need to be reconfigured
- Test is the most complicated because you need to link files outside of the project directory.

#### MacOS, ARM-based (M chip)

- Use the correct Eclipse install for your Mac hardware (Mac silicon is aarch64)
- Follow the instructions above (import, select configuration, compile)
- Rename .dll file to have .dylib extension
- Make sure that the 'dll_filename' variable in your Python script matches your new file name and extension

#### Raspberry Pi - Graphical

- Use the correct Eclipse install for your ARM hardware
- Follow the instructions above (import, select configuration, compile)
- Rename .dll file to have .so extension
- Make sure that the 'dll_filename' variable in your Python script matches your new file name and extension

#### Raspberry Pi - Console/headless

- Compile using this bash script

```
#!/bin/bash
set -e
cd "$(dirname "$0")"
gcc -Iinc -O3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -o src/flexsea_command.o src/flexsea_command.c
gcc -Iinc -O3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -o src/flexsea_codec.o src/flexsea_codec.c
gcc -Iinc -O3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -o src/flexsea_tools.o src/flexsea_tools.c
gcc -Iinc -O3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -o src/circ_buf.o src/circ_buf.c
gcc -Iinc -O3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -o src/flexsea.o src/flexsea.c
gcc -shared -o libflexsea-v2_rpi.dylib src/circ_buf.o src/flexsea.o src/flexsea_codec.o src/flexsea_command.o src/flexsea_tools.o
```

- Rename .dll file to have .so extension
- Make sure that the 'dll_filename' variable in your Python script matches your new file name and extension

### How to use FlexSEA with your embedded project

1. We recommend placing the 'flexsea-v2' directory at the same level as 'your_project'.
1. Add 'flexsea-v2/inc' to your include folders (Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings > MCU GCC Compiler > Include paths)
1. Add 'flexsea-v2/src' to your source folders (Properties > C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols > Source Location > Link folder)
  - Note: if you Link it in Debug, you might have to simply Add it in Release, otherwise the IDE will say it already exists
1. Add `#include <flexsea.h>` to your main file. At this point, you should be able to compile the stack alongside your project.
1. To complete the integration:
  1. Copy/paste fx_def.h, fx_receive.h & fx_transmit.h to your project
  1. Modify main.h to include flexsea.h, and these
  1. Modify main.c to include these three files
1. Follow the example 'stm32_c' project to see how the stack can be used. There is too much to document here, but a few key points are:
  1. Feed bytes into the circular buffer when they are received (via HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback())
  1. Once new bytes have been received, try parsing them
  1. Call the appropriate function to deal with the received commands
  1. If you use structures, align them

### How to use FlexSEA with your Python project

1. Start by copying the content of demo/pc_python/flexsea_demo.py
1. Adjust the sys.path.append command to point to your FlexSEA Python module (ex.: `sys.path.append('../flexsea-v2/flexsea_python')`)
1. To get PyCharm to recognize the imported sources, click on File > Settings... > Project: (Project Name) > Project Structure > Add Content Root > Select flexsea_python > Mark as Sources.
1. Decoding the received data:
  - Manually:
    - Use the `flexsea_tools.py` functions to go from bytes to integers/floats.
	- The first valid byte is in `buf[1]`
	- Calling `bytes_to_uint32(buf[2:6])` will decode bytes 2, 3, 4 & 5. The next decoder should use 6 as a start.

### Stack configuration

A few `#define` can be used to change the size of buffers and communication packets.

- flexsea_codec.h/MAX_ENCODED_PAYLOAD_BYTES:
  - The size can be adjusted based on your microcontroller's memory, and communication interface
  - 48 bytes has been used as the default, based on limitations of the original stack
  - 200 bytes is currently being tested, so far so good
  - Do not exceed 256!
- circ_buf.h/CIRC_BUF_SIZE:
  - Make it large enough to hold a few communication packets
  - If you are not RAM limited, bigger is better

It is critical to use the same `#define` values on the embedded side, and on the PC side. This means recompiling the libraries if those values are changed, and updating `flexsea_python.py`.

### Adding your own commands
